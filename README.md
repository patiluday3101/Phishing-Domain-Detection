# Phishing Attack Domain Detection with Machine Learning


Submit any URL to our platform, and our machine learning model will analyze it and determine if it is malicious or safe.

## üéØ Objective

Phishing attacks are a common type of cybercrime where attackers trick users into providing sensitive information (such as login credentials or account details) by masquerading as trustworthy entities. The ease with which attackers can manipulate users into clicking malicious links makes phishing a favored method of attack.

This project aims to build an intelligent system capable of identifying phishing domains, helping to protect users from fraudulent websites. The solution involves training multiple machine learning models to classify URLs as either legitimate or malicious. Along with this, a web interface and REST APIs are provided to offer a user-friendly experience for accessing the model‚Äôs predictions.

## Project Workflow

The project follows the standard machine learning process, broken down into four main stages:

1. **Data Collection** ‚Äì Gathering legitimate and phishing URLs for training.
2. **Feature Extraction** ‚Äì Extracting relevant features from the URLs to improve model accuracy.
3. **Model Training & Evaluation** ‚Äì Training different machine learning models and selecting the one that performs best.
4. **Deployment** ‚Äì Deploying the trained model for easy access and real-time predictions.

## 1. Data Collection

For this project, we needed a substantial dataset of legitimate and phishing URLs. We used a dataset containing **450k URLs**, where **345k are legitimate** and **104k are malicious**. To combat the imbalance in the dataset, we applied the **SOMTE oversampling technique**, which boosted the dataset size to **600k URLs**.

## 2. Feature Extraction

The dataset only contains the URLs themselves, so we extracted a variety of features to enhance the data‚Äôs quality for training. The extracted features fall into the following categories:

- **Length-based Features**: 5 features based on the length of various URL components.
- **Count-based Features**: 11 features based on the frequency of specific characters or patterns within the URL.
- **Binary Features**: 2 features that represent binary characteristics of the URL (such as the presence of special characters).

In total, we extracted **18 features** for each URL to help improve model performance.

_For detailed information on the features, check out the file 'Phishing Websites Features.docx'._

## 3. Model Training & Evaluation

The core task of this project is a **binary classification** problem, where the goal is to classify URLs as either legitimate (0) or phishing (1). Several machine learning algorithms were tested for this task:

- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**

Out of these, the **MLP** model delivered the highest accuracy (**99%**), offering a good balance between precision and recall. The trained model has been saved for future use.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Running Locally

To get started with this project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepeshdm/Phishing-Attack-Domain-Detection.git
   cd Phishing-Attack-Domain-Detection
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies** within a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the model** by importing the `get_prediction()` function from `API.py` and passing the necessary arguments. Here‚Äôs an example:
   ```python
   from API import get_prediction

   # Path to the trained model
   model_path = r"/models/Malicious_URL_Prediction.h5"

   # Input URL
   url = "www.tesla.com/"

   # Get the prediction for whether the URL is malicious
   prediction = get_prediction(url, model_path)
   print(prediction)
   ```

## üî• Web Interface & API Documentation

To make it easy for users to interact with the model, we built a clean and simple web interface using **ReactJS**, deployed on **Heroku**. In addition, a **REST API** has been created, allowing developers to integrate this phishing detection system into their own applications.

- **Backend API Repository**:

## Future Improvements

Although this project demonstrates the complete process of developing and deploying a machine learning model, there are areas for improvement:

- **Gathering More Data**: Additional data, especially with fewer "sparse" features, would further enhance model performance.
- **Feature Selection**: Reducing the number of features through careful selection could help improve both accuracy and speed.
- **Optimizing for Precision**: Future versions could optimize the model for **precision**, potentially reducing false positives.
